# WebAutomationFramework

## Overview

WebAutomationFramework is a robust Selenium-based automation framework designed to test web applications efficiently across multiple browsers and operating systems. The framework leverages modern development practices like test parallelization, cutting-edge tools (NUnit, Selenium WebDriver), and integrations with cloud-based automation services like LambdaTest for cross-browser testing.

This repository contains automated test examples for validating features like “Simple Form Demo,” “Input Form Submit,” and “Drag & Drop Sliders” using LambdaTest's Selenium Playground as the test application. 

The codebase is designed for extensibility, allowing developers to quickly add new tests and configurations for web automation tasks.

## Features

1. **Cross-browser testing**:
    - Perform automated tests across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari browsers.
    - Cross-platform support for major operating systems like Windows and macOS using LambdaTest.

2. **Cloud Browser Automation**:
    - Integrated with LambdaTest for running tests on a cloud-based Selenium grid.
    - Real-time reporting and test status updates via LambdaTest.

3. **Parallel Test Execution**:
    - Run tests in parallel using NUnit for faster execution.

4. **Reusable Design Patterns**:
    - Page Object Model (POM) ensures clean and maintainable test scripts.

5. **Configurable Environments**:
    - Store test configuration settings such as URLs and environment variables in `.gitpod.yml` and `appsettings.json` files.
